 /**
   *  class Markdown
   *
   *  Markdown processing in Javascript done right. We have very particular views
   *  on what constitutes 'right' which include:
   *
   *  - produces well-formed HTML (this means that em and strong nesting is
   *    important)
   *
   *  - has an intermediate representation to allow processing of parsed data (We
   *    in fact have two, both as [JsonML]: a markdown tree and an HTML tree).
   *
   *  - is easily extensible to add new dialects without having to rewrite the
   *    entire parsing mechanics
   *
   *  - has a good test suite
   *
   *  This implementation fulfills all of these (except that the test suite could
   *  do with expanding to automatically run all the fixtures from other Markdown
   *  implementations.)
   *
   *  ##### Intermediate Representation
   *
   *  *TODO* Talk about this :) Its JsonML, but document the node names we use.
   *
   *  [JsonML]: http://jsonml.org/ "JSON Markup Language"
